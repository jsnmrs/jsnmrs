## Hi, I&rsquo;m Jason

A surprising number of folks go by the same name. Their friends email me all the time.

I live in upstate New York with my [talented significant other](https://katydecorah.com) and our 5-year-old kiddo.

Iâ€™m a [Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA)](https://www.credly.com/badges/3440d3f6-a554-400a-b43d-69f129c2a8df/) who works as a Senior Digital Accessibility Consultant at [Perkins Access](https://perkinsaccess.org/). I also co-tinker at [doublegreat.dev](https://doublegreat.dev/). I typed my first bit of HTML in a Notepad window sometime in 1998 and have been <a rel="me" href="https://jasonmorris.com">writing code</a> ever since. <a rel="me" href="https://indieweb.social/@jasonmorris">Infrequent tooter</a> and <a rel="me" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsnmrs/">always professional</a> could also describe me.
